As a record number of members of Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN) prepared to take up their seats
 in parliament after last weekend’s election, an instruction was sent from party headquarters: the
 men among them should wear ties and the women jackets.

The message was clear: 50 years after its foundation as the National Front by Le Pen’s
rabble-rousing father, Jean-Marie, the party sees itself at the heart of French politics — and its
89 deputies, the biggest opposition group to President Emmanuel Macron, must look the part.
